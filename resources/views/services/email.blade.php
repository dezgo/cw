<h1>Email Services</h1>
Email has been around since the early '70s, and today virtually anyone using the
internet has an email address. According to <a target="_blank" class="extlink"
href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Email-Statistics-Report-2013-2017-Executive-Summary.pdf">
The Radicati Group's Email Statistics Report, 2013-2017</a>, in 2013 there were 3.9 billion email accounts and over 180 billion
emails sent per day!<br>
<br>
In the past, a program like Outlook Express was configured to receive emails
directly on your PC, generally using a protocol called 'POP'. This was great
when the internet was accessed using a dial-up modem as you could connect once,
download all your emails, then review them and compose responses without having to
stay connected and thus not use the phone line.<br>
<br>
Nowadays with technologies like ADSL and mobile data connections, making a phone
call and occupying the phone line while online seems ludicrous. Many people also
now have multiple devices they'd like to check email on, so having all their emails
on the one desktop computer is inconvenient - enter webmail.<br>
<br>
Webmail has been around for a long time, but whereas before it was inconvenient
having to be online whenever you wanted to check email, now with fast and permanent
connections to the internet, that is no longer an issue. Furthermore, webmail allows
users to leave their email online and thus access it from multiple devices. They
also get the added advantage of not having to worry about backups. With emails
stored online, if your PC dies, your emails don't die with it.<br>
<br>
So now the question is, you have you old ISP email address - joe@isp.com, but really
want to move to a webmail address, say joe@gmail.com. But what about all those people
who already know your old address - joe@isp.com? Well if you sign up for a Gmail account,
you can set it up to check your old address automatically. Any emails that come
to joe@isp.com will automatically be collected and appear in your webmail account.
Here's a video I put together some years ago now which explains how to do that.

Note other webmail platforms like outlook and yahoo offer a similar service, so don't
feel you have to use Gmail for this to work. Also remember, if you like the idea
if a webmail account, but already use a different program (email client) to check emails
 (say Outlook, Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail, Incredimail), you can
setup that program to check your webmail account too - so you get the best of both
worlds! Just remember when adding your webmail account - use IMAP, not POP.<br>
<br>
Of course if all this sounds great, but you wouldn't know where to start setting
it up, call me - I'd be happy to help :)<br>
